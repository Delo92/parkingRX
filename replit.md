# Handicap Permit Services - Disabled Parking Permit Application Platform

## Overview

This is a white-label handicap parking permit application service with a 4-tier user hierarchy. The platform handles applicant registrations, medical professional review/approval, automated permit document generation, payments, messaging, and workflow automation. Built as a full-stack TypeScript application with React frontend, Express backend, and Firebase Firestore for data storage.

The core workflow follows: Registration → Permit Type Selection → Payment → Provide Details → Medical Review/Approval → Permit Document Generation → Completion.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript, bundled with Vite
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight React router)
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query v5) for server state
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives and Tailwind CSS
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming (light/dark mode support)
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy-loaded pages with React.lazy() and Suspense

The frontend uses a context-based architecture:
- `AuthContext` - User authentication state and methods
- `ConfigContext` - White-label configuration (site name, colors, role names)
- `ThemeProvider` - Dark/light theme management

Path aliases are configured: `@/` for client/src, `@shared/` for shared code, `@assets/` for attached assets.

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication with Bearer token verification (stateless, no server-side sessions)
- **API Pattern**: RESTful endpoints under `/api/` prefix

### Data Layer
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Schema Location**: `shared/schema.ts` (shared between frontend and backend)
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit with `db:push` command for schema sync
- **Validation**: Zod schemas generated from Drizzle schemas via drizzle-zod

### User Hierarchy (4 Levels)
1. **Level 1 - Applicant**: End users who register support animals and submit applications
2. **Level 2 - Doctor/Reviewer**: Reviews applications via secure email links (no login required), approves/denies
3. **Level 3 - Admin**: Manage users, registration types, assign applications to doctors, and system settings
4. **Level 4 - Owner**: Full platform control, white-label configuration

Role names are configurable per deployment via the `siteConfig` table.

### Key Data Models
- `users` - All platform users with role levels
- `packages` - Service offerings with pricing
- `applications` - User applications linked to packages
- `applicationSteps` - Workflow step tracking
- `documents` - File uploads and document management
- `messages` - Internal messaging system
- `payments` - Payment records
- `commissions` - Referral/agent commission tracking
- `notifications` - User notifications
- `activityLogs` - Audit trail
- `siteConfig` - White-label customization
- `doctorProfiles` - Doctor credentials (license, NPI, DEA, phone, fax, address, specialty)
- `doctorReviewTokens` - Secure single-use tokens for doctor review links (token, applicationId, doctorId, status, expiresAt)
- `autoMessageTriggers` - Automated messages triggered on application status changes
- `adminSettings` - Admin settings including `lastAssignedDoctorId` for round-robin doctor assignment

### Site Media Management
All landing page images are configurable from the Owner's Site Settings > Site Media tab. Each slot supports:
- **Image URLs** (.jpg, .png, .webp, .gif)
- **Video URLs** (.mp4, .webm) - autoplay, loop, muted
- **Vimeo embeds** (paste vimeo.com link, auto-converted to embed)

Configurable media slots stored in Firebase `siteConfig`:
- `heroMediaUrl` - Hero section background
- `aboutMediaUrl` - About section image
- `ctaMediaUrl` - CTA section background
- `contactMediaUrl` - Contact/footer CTA background
- `departmentMediaUrls[]` - Department section images (5 slots)
- `testimonialMediaUrls[]` - Testimonial profile images (5 slots)
- `galleryImages[]` - Gallery section (unlimited slots)

Component: `client/src/components/MediaRenderer.tsx` - detects type from URL and renders img/video/iframe.

### Build System
- **Development**: Vite dev server with HMR, proxied through Express
- **Production**: Vite builds to `dist/public`, esbuild bundles server to `dist/index.cjs`
- **Bundling Strategy**: Server dependencies in allowlist are bundled to reduce cold start times

## External Dependencies

### Database
- **Firebase Firestore**: Primary data store via Firebase Admin SDK
- **Connection**: Firebase service account key via `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` secret

### Frontend Libraries
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui (Radix UI + Tailwind)
- **Forms**: react-hook-form with @hookform/resolvers and Zod
- **Date Handling**: date-fns
- **Charts**: Recharts (via shadcn chart component)

### Backend Libraries
- **Authentication**: bcryptjs for password hashing
- **File Uploads**: multer for multipart form data (gallery image uploads stored in `uploads/gallery/`)

### Development Tools
- **Replit Plugins**: @replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal, cartographer, dev-banner
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode with module bundler resolution

### Environment Variables Required
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string (required)
- `VITE_FIREBASE_*` - Optional Firebase configuration for enhanced auth

## Current Implementation Status

- **Application Workflow**: 3-step wizard for creating new applications
- **Package Management**: Browse and select service packages
- **Doctor Review System**: Secure token-based review links sent to doctors (no login required)
- **Round-Robin Doctor Assignment**: Admin sends applications to doctors with automatic rotation

- **Dark/Light Theme**: System-aware with manual toggle

### Application Processing Workflow

The complete workflow for processing applications through the platform:

1. Level 1 (Applicant) creates account, selects package, completes payment
2. Application created with status `pending`
3. Level 3 (Admin) sends application to a doctor via "Send to Doctor" button
   - Uses round-robin rotation to auto-assign doctors fairly
   - Generates a secure one-time review link (expires in 7 days)
   - Application status changes to `doctor_review`
4. Doctor receives review link, opens public review portal (no login needed)
   - Reviews patient info, application details, form data
   - **Approves** → `doctor_approved` → auto-generates certificate document
   - **Denies** → `doctor_denied` → patient notified with reason
5. Upon approval, patient receives notification and certificate is available

**Application Status Values:**
- `pending` - New application, ready to be sent to doctor
- `doctor_review` - Sent to doctor, awaiting their decision
- `doctor_approved` - Approved by doctor, certificate generated
- `doctor_denied` - Denied by doctor
- `level3_work` - In admin work queue (optional processing)
- `completed` - Fully completed
- `rejected` - Application rejected

### Doctor Review Token System
- **Secure Tokens**: 32-byte hex tokens, single-use, expire in 7 days
- **Public Review Portal**: `/review/:token` - no authentication required
- **Round-Robin Assignment**: `adminSettings.lastAssignedDoctorId` tracks rotation
- **Auto-Assignment**: Cycles through active doctors fairly (like a draft system)
- **Manual Override**: Admin can specify a particular doctor when sending
